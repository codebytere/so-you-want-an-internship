## Are You Ready? :eyes:
Short answer: **YES**. Long answer: **YYYYYYEEEEEESSSSSSSSSSS**.

### Freshman

Your options are definitely more limited after only your first year in college, but you shouldn't let that hold you back from applying at all! There are a solid number of companies that have internship programs targeted to freshman. Some of these are:
* Google (Engineering Practicum Internship)
* Facebook (Facebook U Internship)
* Microsoft (Microsoft Explore Internship)

These are absolutely worth applying to, but don’t rely on getting them or sometimes even hearing back. They’re highly competitive and you should keep looking after applying. It's also a great idea to to try local companies in your area. Even if they don’t list an internship application, sending an email can’t hurt. This was actually how I got my first software engineering
internship!

### Sophomore

Once you’ve taken or are taking Data Structures and Algorithms, you have all the knowledge you need to start. At this point, if you're looking for your first internship, you should work towards creating a side project or two. Having side projects are key to answering behavioral questions in an interview and attracting attention to your resume. The next step is to start preparing for interviews. This includes both behavioral and technical. Your Data Structures and Algorithms class is a good start to preparing for technical questions. See [Technical Interviews](#technical-interviews-computer) for more!

### Junior

As a junior, companies are going to expect you to know your Data Structures and Algorithms inside and out. Practice technical questions, both on an online resource and a whiteboard. With that said, even if you don’t have the technical questions down it's still smart to apply as applications open. It's definitely better to be early and fail a few interviews than to wait until the last minute and have all the spots be full. Chances are you won’t get an offer at the first company you interview with, but that's ok! Every interview can be taken as a learning experience towards your next one. Most big companies interview in a language-agnostic manner, but some smaller ones ask you to interview in a language they themselves use so be sure you're prepared for both options.

## Technical Interviews :computer:

You should have a fairly robust understanding of data structure & algorithms,
as well as how to use them appropriately.

See [this](https://github.com/andreis/interview) great repo for a thorough overview of what you should know.

## Resume :books:

### Building Your Resume

1. **Focus on accomplishments**
  * Focus less on your job duties in your last job and more on what you actually accomplished, with an emphasis on tangible results (increased app sales revenues by 20 percent, developed software that reduced costs by 10  percent, etc.).

2. **Quantify results**
  * Avoid saying general things like “improved customer satisfaction,”
  “increased company profits,” or “reduced number of bugs.”
  * Instead, provide quantifiable metrics that demonstrate how your work helped your company save money, reduce costs, improve customer service, etc.

3. **Target your resume to your career**
  * If you're seeking a software engineering internship, your job as a camp
  counselor before college shouldn't be included on your resume.

4. **Don’t get too technical**
  * Remember that not all recruiters are technical, so you want to make sure you balance describing your experience with making it understandable for less technical readers.

5. **Be concise**
  * Your resume should never be more than one page.

6. **Be clear, and structure your resume well**
  * Try to think like a recruiter when creating your resume.
  * Provide the information recruiters want so that they don’t throw your resume in the trash pile.

7. **Ditch the “objective.”**
  * Use an Objective in your resume only if you are right out of college or
  want to bring attention to the fact that you want to transition to a new role (for example, moving from a position in software engineering to one in sales).

8. **Don’t be vague in your “summary.”**
  * If you use a summary section, be sure that it’s filled with key accomplishments (backed up by hard numbers), not vague pronouncements about your detail-oriented personality, strong work ethic, etc.

9. **Include skills**.
  * This section should list software expertise, programming languages, foreign  languages, and other applicable skills, but it’s a good idea to skip basic skills (such as Microsoft Word) that many applicants have.
  * The key is to list skills that will help you land the job.
  * Don't include skill bars; if you really want to group by proficiency, group under one of several categories such as "proficient", "familiar", or "learning."

10. **Use keywords**
  * At its employment web site, Microsoft advises applicants to detail on their resume how their experiences (leadership roles, work duties, school activities, etc.) helped them to grow as a person and as a professional.
    * This is a good approach, since you always want to show that you are evolving
    as a person and eager to learn new skills.
    * Also, use keywords that match those listed in the job announcement.
      * For example, if you’re applying for a position in e-marketing and
      search engine optimization, then your resume should include these terms.
      * This will help you get noticed by resume-scanning software and
      advance past the first screening stage.

### Resume Design

There are countless options for designing a resume. Some of my personal favorites include:
* [ineedaresume](http://ineedaresu.me/)
* [LaTeX Resume](https://latexresu.me)
* [Best Resume Ever](https://github.com/salomonelli/best-resume-ever)

You can also design your own instead of using a service, if you'd prefer. When I updated
mine for summer 2017, I ended up redesigning it in Sketch.

## Cover Letters :love_letter:

Unless a cover letter is _required_, there is no need to write one. It won't ever
hurt you to write it, but recruiters generally don't read them or care if you do.

If you do feel a need to write one, be sure to cover the following:

1. **Who** are you?
2. **What** can you do for them or bring to their company?
3. **When** can you start?
4. **Where** are you coming from?
5. **Why** are you interested in working for their company?
6. **How** can they get back in contact with you?

## Referrals :grin: :heart: :grin:

Referrals are major :key: if you can get them. They push you towards the top of
the mountain of resumes that companies get every single day, and so they're more
valuable then they first appear. Looking for relations you've built through
school/classes, from past internships, or clubs is a great starting place. All
it takes is a simple ask! You can most often get a referral from current
employees, former ones, interns, or former interns.

However, there are a few things to keep in mind before you ask for a referral.
You primarily want to keep your referral requests to people you know more than in
passing. If they can vouch for you as a person as well as an engineer, they're
far more likely to refer you than if they don't know you well enough to speak
to either.

    * If you've contributed significantly to an OSS project, recruiters will
    want to know that!
### Personal Website
  * Having a personal website is not a make-it-or-break-it, but it's a great way to show off some of your skills in a more fun way.
  * Oftentimes, a great personal website can be a project in itself!
    * For examples, take a look at some of these awesome [personal websites](http://www.creative-portfolios.com/)!

### LinkedIn
* You should have a LinkedIn account, and it should essentially mirror your resume.
